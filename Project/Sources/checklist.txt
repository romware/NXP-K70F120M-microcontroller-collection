VRR – Basic Functionality

/2 G A P Voltage sampling.
Three channels have synchronous sampling.						- Moslty done
16 samples per cycle at 50 Hz.									- Mostly done, Switch to sliding window
Hard real-time constraint met.									- Done

/6 G A P True RMS. 
Measurement of true RMS for voltage.							- Done
Speed of calculation.											- Mostly done, check data types and efficiency
Efficiency of algorithm.										- Mostly done, check data types and efficiency

/4 G A P Outputs.
Three channel operation is aggregated 							- Done
	(raise/lower initiated on any channel).
Alarm signal.													- Done
Non-volatile storage of number of raise/lower events.			- Mostly done. Check threads are ok for writing to flash

/6 G A P Timing. 
Definite.
Inverse.

VRR – Intermediate Functionality

/5 G A P Sample rate. 
16 samples per cycle 
	(i.e. frequency measurement to 0.1 Hz and tracking).

/5 G A P RTOS. 
Multiple threads are used with an RTOS – i.e. 
	one thread for analog, 
	one thread for PC comms, 
	one thread for logic, etc.

/2 G A P Settings / interrogation.
Tower protocol expanded to achieve Intermediate Functionality.
