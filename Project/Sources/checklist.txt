VRR – Basic Functionality

/2 G A P Voltage sampling.
Three channels have synchronous sampling.						- Done
16 samples per cycle at 50 Hz.									- Done
Hard real-time constraint met.									- Done

/6 G A P True RMS. 
Measurement of true RMS for voltage.							- Done
Speed of calculation.											- Done
Efficiency of algorithm.										- Moslty Done. Need to change square root function

/4 G A P Outputs.

	(raise/lower initiated on any channel).
Alarm signal.													- Done
Non-volatile storage of number of raise/lower events.			- Done

/6 G A P Timing. 
Definite.														- Done
Inverse.														- Done
Accuracy.														- Mostly Done. Check 1s minimum and efficiency

VRR – Intermediate Functionality

/5 G A P Sample rate. 
16 samples per cycle 											- Moslty Done. Need to optimise float point calculations
	(i.e. frequency measurement to 0.1 Hz and tracking).

/5 G A P RTOS. 
Multiple threads are used with an RTOS – i.e.					- Done
	one thread for analog, 
	one thread for PC comms, 
	one thread for logic, etc.

/2 G A P Settings / interrogation.
Tower protocol expanded to achieve Intermediate Functionality.	- Done
